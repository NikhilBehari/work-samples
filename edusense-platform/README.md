**edusense-platform**: [EduSense](https://www.edusense.io) is an open-source platform for classroom environment sensing and automatic instructor feedback generation. It uses a computer vision-based system to track instructor and student behaviors throughout class sessions, and provides information to instructors to enable high-quality, independent professional development. 

This repository contains the code for the EduSense platform, an intelligent interface used to process, interpret, and present automatically generated classroom data to instructors. I developed this web application from scratch using the React.js, Node, Express, GraphQL, and MongoDB (MERNG) stack, and using my developed statistical approach to present insights to instructors.
